# Standalone reproduction for issue #75: the publish-dockerhub composite action
# booted buildx with no pinned-image pre-pull, so the docker-container driver
# pulled moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1 straight from Docker Hub at boot. A
# transient registry-1.docker.io outage there failed the whole publish job.
#
# The fix lives in .github/actions/setup-buildx-resilient/action.yml: pre-pull
# the pinned BuildKit image with retries + a mirror.gcr.io pull-through
# fallback, re-tag the mirror image to the canonical reference, then boot
# buildx with driver-opts pinned to the (now locally cached) image.
#
# This script extracts the real pre-pull `run:` block out of the action and
# drives it with a mock `docker` so the recovery behaviour can be exercised
# offline. The same logic is covered in CI by tests/setup-buildx-resilient.test.js.
