## Development Workflow

Use Node.js 24 with npm 10.9 or newer for development and release tooling.
Changesets 3 requires a supported Node.js 22.11, 24, or 26+ runtime.

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. **Install dependencies**: `bun install` (or `npm install`)
4. **Make your changes**
5. **Run local checks**: `bun run check`
6. **Create a changeset**: `bun run changeset`
7. **Commit and push** (pre-commit hooks will run automatically)
8. **Create a Pull Request**

## Code Standards

### File Size Limits

**Maximum 1500 lines per file** (enforced via ESLint `max-lines` rule and CI `check-file-line-limits` job).

This benefits both AI and human developers by ensuring files remain readable and maintainable.

### Formatting and Linting

All code must pass:

```bash
# Check formatting
bun run format:check

# Check linting
bun run lint

# Run all checks
bun run check
```

The pre-commit hook runs automatically, but you can also manually format and fix:

```bash
# Auto-fix formatting
bun run format

# Auto-fix lint issues
bun run lint:fix
```

### Testing Requirements

Tests should:

- Cover critical paths
- Work across all runtimes (Node.js, Bun, Deno)
- Use the [test-anywhere](https://github.com/link-foundation/test-anywhere) framework

```bash
# Run tests
bun test --timeout 30000
npm test
deno test --allow-read --allow-env
npm run check:secrets
```

Deno needs environment permission for the required Secretlint dependency. Run runtime suites sequentially because Deno manages the shared npm directory automatically; restore `npm ci` before returning to Node/Bun tooling.

## Version Management with Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions and changelogs. This eliminates merge conflicts that occur when multiple PRs bump the version in `package.json`.

### Adding a Changeset

When you make changes that affect users, add a changeset:

```bash
bun run changeset
# or
npm run changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select the type of change (patch/minor/major)
2. Provide a summary of the changes

The changeset will be saved as a markdown file in `.changeset/` and should be committed with your PR.

### Changeset Guidelines

| Type      | When to Use                          | Examples                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Patch** | Bug fixes, internal changes          | Fix typo, update dependency, refactor internal code |
| **Minor** | New features, non-breaking additions | Add new function, new optional parameter            |
| **Major** | Breaking changes                     | Remove function, change API signature               |

Example changeset summary:

```markdown
Add support for custom configuration via config file
```

### What Changes Need Changesets?

**Required** for:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Breaking changes
- Public API changes

**Not required** for:

- Documentation-only changes (in `./docs` folder)
- Changes to markdown files
- CI/CD workflow updates (unless they affect users)

### PR guard comparison and local validation

Version and changeset guards compare the PR head with its merge base. CI passes
`GITHUB_BASE_SHA` and `GITHUB_HEAD_SHA`; local runs default to `origin/main` and
`HEAD`. Fetch the base before running the guards. Missing refs, Git failures,
and invalid package metadata fail validation.

The changeset guard counts added fragments only. Markdown, `docs/`, `examples/`,
`experiments/`, `dev/log/`, and changeset metadata are exempt. In multi-language
repositories, unrelated language roots are exempt; shared workflows still
require a fragment. For local directory validation without Git comparison, use
`ALLOW_LOCAL_CHANGESET_SCAN=true node scripts/validate-changeset.mjs`. This
explicit mode is forbidden in CI. Set `DEBUG=1` to print comparison details.

Automated release PRs are exempt only when their author matches the release
actor, both repositories match `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, and their branch uses a
release prefix. The default author is `github-actions[bot]`. When a dedicated
release token creates PRs as another account, configure repository variable
`RELEASE_PR_ACTOR` to that account's exact login. A branch name alone never
grants an exemption.

## Release Process

The release process is fully automated:

1. **PR with changeset merged** - The changeset is added to `.changeset/`
2. **CI detects changesets** - On push to main, CI checks for pending changesets
3. **Version bump** - Package version is updated based on changeset type
4. **Changelog update** - `CHANGELOG.md` is updated automatically
5. **npm publish** - Package is published via OIDC trusted publishing
6. **GitHub Release** - A release is created with formatted notes

### Multiple Changesets

If multiple PRs are merged before a release:

- All changesets are merged into one
- The highest version bump type wins (major > minor > patch)
- All descriptions are preserved in chronological order

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title

Use a clear, descriptive title that summarizes the change:

```
feat: Add support for custom configuration
fix: Resolve race condition in async handler
docs: Update API documentation for v2
```

### PR Description

Include:

- **What** - Describe the change
- **Why** - Explain the motivation
- **Testing** - How the change was tested

### CI Checks

All PRs must pass:

- [ ] Test compilation (syntax check)
- [ ] Lint, format, and secrets scan
- [ ] File line limits check
- [ ] Changeset validation (for code changes)
- [ ] Documentation validation (when docs change)
- [ ] Tests on all platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Tests on all runtimes (Node.js, Bun, Deno)

### Fresh Merge Simulation

The CI workflow automatically:

1. Merges the latest `main` into your PR branch
2. Runs checks against the merged state

If this fails with merge conflicts, you need to:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
# Resolve conflicts
git push
```
