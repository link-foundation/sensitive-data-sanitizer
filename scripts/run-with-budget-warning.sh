# run-with-budget-warning.sh
#
# Owns the deadline for a long CI step so the step, not the job, decides
# when time has run out.
#
# `timeout-minutes` on a job is a backstop, never the deadline: GitHub
# reports a job killed by it as *cancelled*, not *failed*, so a genuine
# overrun can pass unnoticed on a pull request and cannot name the
# deadline it blew on the default branch. A step that owns its own budget
# exits non-zero instead, which GitHub reports as a failure with a title
# naming the budget and the overrun.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/run-with-budget-warning.sh SECONDS LABEL COMMAND [ARG...]
#
# Environment:
#   BUDGET_WARN_PERCENT   emit a warning at this share of the budget (default 70)
#   BUDGET_GRACE_SECONDS  seconds between SIGTERM and SIGKILL (default 10)
#   BUDGET_KILL_SECONDS   seconds to wait for SIGKILL to take effect (default 5)
#   BUDGET_POLL_SECONDS   polling interval while the command runs (default 1)
#   BUDGET_SUDO_KILL      use passwordless sudo to signal survivors (default 1)
#   BUDGET_CAPTURE_OUTPUT relay output so survivors cannot hold the step open
#                         (default 1)
#   BUDGET_STATE_PARENT   parent for private state (default RUNNER_TEMP, then
#                         TMPDIR or /tmp)
#   BUDGET_VERBOSE        trace liveness and signalling decisions (default 0)
#
# Exit codes: the command's own status, or 124 on timeout (matching timeout(1)).
